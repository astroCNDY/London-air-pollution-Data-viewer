# London-air-pollution-Data-viewer
This project loads government-published air-quality datasets (NO₂, PM10, PM2.5) and displays them interactively on a detailed map of London. Users can explore pollution patterns across six years, inspect grid-level data, and view statistical trends across time and pollutant types.
